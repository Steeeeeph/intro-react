# ➕ todos²

## "An intro to the React.js framework"

The challenge is about making a simple app for storing your todo's. It handles the most important syntax, way of thinking in structured components and methods with hooks.

Check this app out yourself: [todos²](https://todos-todos.netlify.app)

## 🚧 Road blocks

+ Designing a logical component structure
+ Syntax specific referring via the methods
+ Given errors weren't always that clear
+ 📝 TODO-possibilities:
  + Button for clearing the done tasks
  + Maybe getting some rearranging for the uncompleted tasks to float on top
  + Possibility of making different lists with adjustable titles

## 🧰 Toolbox

+ React.js + JavaScript
+ HTML
+ new.CSS
+ VSCode
+ Netlify
+ GitHub
